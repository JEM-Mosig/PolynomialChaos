# PolynomialChaos
Mathematica package for generalized polynomial chaos

## About

The `PolynomialChaos` Mathematica package provides various routines to work with generalized polynomial chaos (gPC).
For example, it defines the function `Collocation`, which can be used to estimate expectation, variance, and other statistical properties of a given model `f[z]` when `z` is a random variable with a prescribed probability distribution.
A general introduction into the gPC framework is given by Xiu, _Numerical methods for stochastic computations: a spectral method approach_, 2010.
